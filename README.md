# flickr_downloader
Automate downloading of many related images with one short Python script. 

## Usage
1. First, go to flickr.com and get an api_key and an api_secret.
2. Paste the api key and secret into the script.
3. python download_photos.py \<name of dir to create> \<search topic> \<num images to download>

## But WHY?
I'm retraining Google's Convolutional Neural Network Inception to classify some images a little better, and I needed a quick way to download ~1000 photos per label.
